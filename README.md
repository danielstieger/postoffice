# postoffice 2.0
This is a very simplistic demo application written with jetbrains MPS and the MoWare Rapid Application Development plugin. It will easily run with a local mysql/mariaDB instance, just create the schema described in a file at 
```
artefacts/schema.txt
```

You can run this demo application with the .war files provided in the releases section and a tomcat 8x. We have used the db-user root with no password set. The 
Build files are also provided in the build folder. More information on moware can be found at our [homepage](https://www.modellwerkstatt.org/moware.html). For more information feel free to contact us at [info@modellwerkstatt.org](mailto:info@modellwerkstatt.org)

We packaged also some configurations to run this application on an oracle DB instance. The oracle express edition is also freely available for demo purposes.
